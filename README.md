A keyboard-driven terminal UI for [Graphite](https://graphite.com) PR stacks —
a replacement for the Graphite VSCode extension's "Branches" sidebar.

Run `graphite-tui` inside any Graphite-initialized git repo and it renders the
repo's stacks with dependency lines, PR status, and age, fully controllable by
keyboard.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/virajvchavan/graphite-tui.git
cd graphite-tui
npm install   # installs deps and builds (via the prepare script)
npm link      # exposes the global `graphite-tui` command
```

Then run `graphite-tui` from inside any Graphite-initialized repo.

Requires Node ≥ 18 and the [`gt`](https://graphite.com/docs/graphite-cli) CLI on
your PATH.

## Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`k`, `↓`/`j` | move selection |
| `Tab` | focus the changed-files panel (then `j`/`k` scroll, `Tab`/`Esc` back) |
| `Enter` / `c` | checkout selected branch |
| `o` / `O` | open PR / stack page on Graphite |
| `g` | open PR on GitHub |
| `s` | sync with trunk (`gt sync`) |
| `r` | restack (`gt restack`) |
| `S` | submit stack (`gt submit --stack`) |
| `d` | delete branch (with confirmation) |
| `/` | fuzzy filter by branch name / PR title |
| `y` | copy PR url or branch name |
| `R` | refresh |
| `?` | help · `q` quit |

A panel below the graph lists the files each branch's PR changes (its diff
against its parent), colored by git status. It updates as you move between
branches; press `Tab` to focus and scroll it.

The view auto-refreshes when you run `gt` in another terminal.

## How it works

`gt log` has no machine-readable output, so the view is built by reading
Graphite's local caches directly (fast, exact):

- **Tree structure** — `.git/.graphite_metadata.db` (SQLite `branch_metadata`)
- **PR metadata** — `.git/.graphite_pr_info` (JSON)
- **Trunk** — `.git/.graphite_repo_config`
- **Ages / current branch** — `git for-each-ref` / `git branch --show-current`
- **Changed files** — `git diff --name-status <parent>...<branch>`

Mutations (checkout, sync, restack, submit, delete) and opening PRs shell out to
`gt`. All Graphite-format parsing is isolated in `src/data/` so a `gt` format
change is a one-place fix.

## Develop

```sh
npm run dev    # run from source via tsx
npm test       # unit tests for the graph layout
npm run build  # compile to dist/
```
